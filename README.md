# Labs64 NetLicensing / Zapier Integration

[![CI - Zapier tests](https://github.com/Labs64/NetLicensing-Zapier/workflows/CI%20-%20Zapier%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Labs64/NetLicensing-Zapier/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI+-+Zapier+tests%22)

[Labs64 NetLicensing](https://netlicensing.io) is a first-class solution in the Licensing as a Service (LaaS) sector. Based on open standards, it provides a cost effective, integrated and scalable platform for software vendors and developers who want to concentrate on their productâ€™s core functionality instead of spending resources on developing an own license management software.

## Integrations

You can use Zapier to do Labs64 NetLicensing Automation.
Please refer to the NetLicensing triggers, searches and actions available at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/netlicensing).

### Security

You need to be authenticated to use NetLicensing API. Use the following authentication options:
- [API Key](https://netlicensing.io/wiki/security) *(recommended)* - provides limited access to the NetLicensing API based on the API Key Role. We suggest using roleId `ROLE_APIKEY_OPERATION` if you need to manage customers and licenses and roleId `ROLE_APIKEY_MAINTENANCE` is you need to manage product details.
